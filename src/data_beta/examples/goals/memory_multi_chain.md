The techniques used in the code could be used for the following project ideas:

1. Question/Answering Chatbot: The code demonstrates how to add memory to a question/answering chain. This could be used to create a chatbot that can answer user questions based on a given set of documents.

2. Document Similarity Search: The code shows how to use embeddings and vector search to perform similarity search on a collection of documents. This could be used to build a search engine that finds similar documents based on a user query.

3. Language Model Memory: The code utilizes a ConversationBufferMemory to store and retrieve conversation history. This could be used to create a language model that can generate responses based on previous interactions.

4. Text Chunking: The code uses a CharacterTextSplitter to split a long document into smaller chunks. This could be used in projects that require processing large amounts of text, such as text summarization or language generation.

5. Prompt-based Language Generation: The code demonstrates how to use a PromptTemplate to generate text based on given variables. This could be used in projects that involve generating text based on specific prompts or templates.

Overall, the techniques in the code could be applied to various natural language processing projects, including chatbots, search engines, language models, and text processing tasks.
