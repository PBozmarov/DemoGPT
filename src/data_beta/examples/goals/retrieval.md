The techniques inside the code can be used for the following project ideas:

1. Question Answering System: The code demonstrates how to use the RetrievalQA module to build a question answering system. It shows how to load text documents, split them into smaller chunks, create embeddings, and perform document search to retrieve relevant information for answering questions.

2. Text Document Search: The code shows how to use the Chroma vector store and the RetrievalQA module to perform document search based on user queries. This can be useful for building a search engine or information retrieval system.

3. Custom Prompt Generation: The code demonstrates how to create a custom prompt template using the PromptTemplate class. This can be used to generate prompts for question answering tasks with specific formatting requirements or context inclusion.

4. Source Document Retrieval: The code shows how to retrieve the source documents used to answer a question by setting the "return_source_documents" parameter to True. This can be useful for citation generation or providing additional context to the user.

5. Source Citing: The code demonstrates how to use the RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain module to cite the sources of information used to answer a question. This can be useful for academic or research projects where proper citation is required.

Overall, the techniques in the code can be applied to projects involving question answering, information retrieval, text search, custom prompt generation, and source document retrieval/citing.
