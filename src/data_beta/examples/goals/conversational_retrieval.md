The techniques inside the code could be used for the following project ideas:

1. Conversational Question Answering: The code demonstrates how to build a ConversationalRetrievalQA system that combines chat history and questions to retrieve relevant documents and provide responses. This technique can be used to create chatbots or virtual assistants that can engage in conversational question answering.

2. Document Retrieval and Semantic Search: The code shows how to split documents, create embeddings for them, and store them in a vectorstore. This allows for semantic search over the documents. This technique can be used in applications that require efficient document retrieval and search, such as information retrieval systems or search engines.

3. Memory-based Conversational Systems: The code includes a memory component that tracks chat history and holds conversations. This technique can be used to create memory-based conversational systems that can maintain context and provide more coherent responses.

4. Multi-model Language Processing: The code demonstrates how to use different language models for different tasks within the ConversationalRetrievalQA system. This technique can be used to leverage the strengths of different models for different parts of the system, such as using a cheaper and faster model for question condensing and a more expensive model for question answering.

5. Source Document Retrieval: The code shows how to return the source documents that were retrieved during the conversation. This technique can be used to provide users with additional information and context by showing them the source documents that were used to generate the response.

6. Streaming Conversational Systems: The code includes an example of streaming the output of the ConversationalRetrievalChain to stdout token by token. This technique can be used to create streaming conversational systems that can provide real-time responses and interact with users in a more dynamic and interactive manner.

7. Customizing Chat History Format: The code allows for customizing the format of the chat history string using a get_chat_history function. This technique can be used to format the chat history in a way that is more suitable for the specific application or user interface.

These techniques can be applied to various project ideas, such as building chatbots, virtual assistants, information retrieval systems, or conversational search engines.
