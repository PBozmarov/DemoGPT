The techniques inside the code can be used for the following project ideas:

1. Question Answering System: The code demonstrates how to use OpenAI functions to create a question answering system. It shows how to retrieve relevant documents, split them into chunks, create embeddings, and use a language model to generate answers.

2. Information Retrieval: The code shows how to use a retrieval pipeline to search for relevant information based on a query. It uses a document retriever and a language model to find and extract answers from the retrieved documents.

3. Conversational AI: The code includes an example of using the ConversationalRetrievalChain to create a conversational AI system. It uses a memory component to store conversation history and a language model to generate responses based on the context and query.

4. Customizing Output Schema: The code demonstrates how to customize the output schema of the question answering system. It shows how to define a custom response schema and use it to parse and structure the output from the language model.

Overall, the techniques in the code can be applied to various projects involving question answering, information retrieval, and conversational AI.
